                <h2>My Childhood</h2>
                <p>I was born in Addis Ababa and raised in Hawassa.My parents have done as good a job anyone can do to
                    raise a kid. I feel proud and honored that I have the privilege to call the my parents.I have had
                    all the things a child dreams of in my childhood. With discipline too.</p>

                <h2>My Academic Background </h2>
                <p>I have not begun my academic as would many peoplke call "a genius". I was just a kid who wanted to be
                    something more and somehow better than what I eas. I got my wish granted. I believe I had quite
                    atremendous success for a kid who started as in place I was. When I look back to see the things I
                    have accomplished, I feel statisfied even by the thought of it.</p>

                <h2>My abilities and Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I firmly believe that I have been bestowed upon quite a lot of gift. From the academics to a an
                    environment I can flourish in, I think I have innumerable gifts that I have not even scratched the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>I have also some hobbies which are entertaining and instructive. I love Photography. I am also fond
                    of Sports such as Football, Basketball and track and field athletics.I also watch documentaries and
                    other informative videos.</p>
